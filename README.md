### Project Scope

The focus of this project is to solve business problems with the following steps: 
1. Identify the factors that affect the high attrition rate.   
2. Create a business dashboard to monitor and provide insights to the Human Resources Department regarding the problem of high attrition rate.   
3. Build a machine learning model to help the Human Resources Department predict employee data, so that they can take proactive action against employees who are indicated to be leaving the company.

## Conclusion

Based on data analysis, some of the factors that could potentially affect the attrition rate are:
- Very high rate of employees working overtime.
- Low monthly income and salary increases.

### Recomandation

- **Overtime Work Policy Evaluation**: Review the company's policy on overtime work. If possible, try to limit excessive overtime work, as it can lead to fatigue and decreased productivity, as well as cause employee dissatisfaction. 
- **Compensation System Review**: Review the company's salary structure and salary increase policy. Ensure that employees feel valued and rewarded according to their contribution and performance. If possible, consider adjusting salary policies or providing additional incentives for employees who do a good job.
- **Employee Development Programs**: Implement training and development programs that can help employees improve their skills and abilities. This can not only improve employee performance, but also increase their attachment to the company.
- **Balanced Work Culture**: Build a work culture that encourages work-life balance. Implement work environments such as working time flexibility, working from home, and flexible leave to help reduce burnout and stress associated with their work.
- Improve communication between management and employees to better understand their needs and expectations.
- **Monitor and Assess Changes**: After implementing changes, it is important to regularly monitor and evaluate their impact. If possible, conduct surveys or interviews with employees to get feedback on the effectiveness of the changes that have been made.
